# This mission file has been moved to the repository root to avoid duplication.
# Canonical mission files live in the `missions/` directory, e.g.:
#   missions/example_mission.yaml
# The satellite service mounts the chosen mission into the container at /app/mission.yaml
# via the docker-compose MISSION variable (default: example_mission).

# (kept intentionally empty to avoid duplication)
